SCCA Rules Visual Aid and Classifier

The idea behind this project is simple. Make it easy to understand the SCCA Classifications rules. Focusing mainly on Solo (Autocross) classifications in the beginning. Initial thought is a turbo tax-esque interface that asks a series of questions and tries to determine your class based on the answers. Also, an interactive visual representation of the classes might be useful. The intention is to initially write a web application and then write a mobile application.

## Rules Breakdown (Just a rough list for v0.1 of this app)

### Street

#### Body Work
* Steering wheels may be changed if the OE wheel does not include an airbag
* Aftermarket steering wheels must be within 1 inch of standard size
* Fenders may not be modified in any way

#### Tires
* Minimum UTQG Treadwear Rating of 200
* DOT Approved

#### Wheels
* Offset +/- 7mm from standard
* Diameter +/- 1" from standard
* Spacers allowed as long as they do not make the wheel exceed the above offset restriction
* Number of bolts/studs cannot change (e.g. 5 lug conversions)

#### Shocks
* No more than 2 types of adjustment
* Suspension Geometry must not be altered

#### Brakes
* Brake line material may be changed
* Clutch lines and brake lines may be solid or braided metal on cars made before 1992

#### Anti-Roll (Sway) Bars
* A single anti-roll bar may be added or removed
* Any bushing material permitted in relation to the anti-roll bars

#### Suspension
* Standard springs (height) must be used. Spring perches must not vary from the OE shape
* Any material is permitted for bushings

#### Electrical
* Ignition systems may not be adjusted outside factory specifications (e.g. timing advance, tune)
* No changes permitted to ECU
* Modifications to the vehicle that allow TC/ESC to be disabled are permitted

#### Engine
* Air filter can be replaced as long as the flow path/shape does not change (OE Filter shape)
* May be overbored up to 0.020" (0.508mm)
* Sleeving to repair standard bore is permitted
* Change from OE piston material is not permitted (e.g. cast -> forged)
* Any part of the exhaust downstream from the last catalytic may be replaced, provided it exits in the original location
* Changes to any part of the exhaust related to emissions (e.g. cats, thermal reactors, pollution control devices) are not allowed
* High performance cats are not allowed

### Street Touring
#### Body Work
* Any steering wheel permitted.
* If the OE steering wheel has an airbag, the aftermarket steering wheel must weigh as much as the OE wheel
* no fender flares or cutting
* fender rolling is permitted
