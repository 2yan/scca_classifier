SCCA Rules Visual Aid and Classifier

The idea behind this project is simple. Make it easy to understand the SCCA Classifications rules. Focusing mainly on Solo (Autocross) classifications in the beginning. Initial thought is a turbo tax-esque interface that asks a series of questions and tries to determine your class based on the answers. Also, an interactive visual representation of the classes might be useful. The intention is to initially write a web application and then write a mobile application.

Current iteration of rules: https://dk1xgl0d43mu1.cloudfront.net/user_files/scca/downloads/000/040/392/2018_Solo_Rules_complete_reduced.pdf
