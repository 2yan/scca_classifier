        <ul class="sansserif list explanation">
          <li>
            The modifications defined here in the Prepared Category are the only allowed
            modifications. The rules in this Section stand on their own; they do not build upon
            the Street, Street Touring®, or Street Prepared category rules. Modifications shall
            not be made unless specifically authorized herein. No permitted component/modification
            shall additionally perform a prohibited function. If the rules do not specifically
            authorize a modification, it is not permitted.
          </li>
          <li>
            It is not permitted to make any changes, alterations, or modifications to any
            component produced by the manufacturer unless specifically authorized by these rules.
          </li>
          <li>
            Any minor modification, intended to allow or facilitate any allowed modification, is
            permitted as long as it does not provide any intrinsic performance benefit in and of
            itself, and is not explicitly prohibited elsewhere within these rules. This rule is
            intended to allow minor notching, bending, clearancing, and grinding; the drilling of
            holes; affixing, relocating, or strengthening of brackets; removal of small parts
            and similar operations performed in order to facilitate the installation of allowed
            parts or modifications. Competitors are strongly cautioned to make the minimum amount
            of modification required to affix a given part and to not make tortured
            interpretations of this rule which will invoke Section 17.11 weight adjustments (e.g.,
            moving frame rails inboard, regardless of the reason, is considered to be a tortured
            interpretation.)

              The external shape of the body may only be changed where specifically authorized.
              Standard window openings, rain gutters, or approved facsimiles shall be retained.
              All external trim and model identification may be removed. Grilles may be removed,
              modified, or substituted.
            </li>
            <li>
              Chassis, frame, or subframe may be reinforced provided components and attachments
              are not relocated except where specifically permitted.  Reinforcing does not
              authorize the use of underbody or belly pans forward of the firewall or aft of the
              front edge of the rear wheel opening.  It is permitted to have jack points recessed
              into the rocker panels or to have one tube per side extending downward through the
              bottom of the door provided they do not extend beyond the overall width of the car
              or in an unsafe or dangerous manner. No part of the bodywork or chassis, to the rear
              of the front wheel opening, shall touch the ground when both tires on the same side
              of the car are deflated.
            </li>
            <li>
              The chassis, frame, or subframe may be notched or cut and brackets may be added for
              the purpose of attaching alternate suspension, steering, or drivetrain components
              except that the firewall may not be modified for engine block or cylinder head
              clearance. Holes may be cut to provide clearance for authorized suspension,
              steering, and drivetrain components through their entire range of travel. Clearance
              between the modified chassis, frame, or subframe and the suspension, steering, and
              drivetrain components is not to exceed 4.0” (101.6 mm). Additional structure may be
              added in order to attach allowed components to the chassis. Relocation, notching, or
              cutting of the chassis, frame, or subframe for tire clearance or moving the wheels
              inboard is not allowed.  Replacement of inner fenders or wheel wells to enable wider
              wheels and tires is allowed.

              Replacement of any chassis component (e.g., subframe) in its entirety by one of
              alternate construction, unless specifically permitted, shall result in the vehicle
              being “in excess” of these rules which will invoke Section 17.11 weight
              adjustments.
            </li>

              The floor in the driver/passenger compartment may be modified for installation of
              subframe connectors, exhaust components, battery boxes, ballast weights, and
              drivetrain clearance. For the same reasons listed, the rear seat floor area, defined
              as the area extending rearward from the back of the driver’s seat to the trunk and
              between the frame rails, may be removed, modified, or replaced. The driver/passenger
              compartment must remain separate from any exhaust and drivetrain components by a
              metal panel. Trunk floors may be modified, removed, or replaced. If replaced, the
              trunk floor must be replaced with metal panels of similar shape to the original.
              Removal of the trunk floor is allowable only when a metal bulkhead separates the
              trunk area from the passenger compartment. The transmission tunnel may be modified
              for the purpose of installing a competition driver seat. The driver’s side floor
              pan may be modified to accommodate larger/taller drivers. All modifications shall
              be contained between the transmission tunnel, driver’s side rocker, rear bulkhead
              and no more than 30” forward of the rear bulkhead. The modification shall not
              extend below the factory floor stiffener/frame rail. The steel used in the
              modification shall be no thinner than .058”. All modifications shall be welded in
              place. This modification shall serve no other purpose other than seating position.
            </li>
            <li>
              The firewall may be notched or recessed for clearance of exhaust headers, electric
              lines, coolant lines, fuel-carrying lines, fuel pumps, intercooling piping,
              carburetors, air horns, air cleaners, and distributor. Any material added to the
              firewall must be either steel or aluminum. This requires a sealed firewall between
              engine and passenger compartment.  This rule is for driver’s safety. Completely
              sealing all firewall openings is strongly encouraged, but no gap may be larger than
              1⁄8 inch (0.125”, 3.2 mm), except around dynamic devices extending through the
              firewall (e.g., throttle linkage, transmission linkage, or other mechanical devic-
              es) and should be sealed to the extent that functioning of the device is not
              impaired. No more than 8.0” (20.3 cm) clearance is allowed between modified
              firewall areas and above listed components. The engine block, cylinder head,
              turbochargers, and/or superchargers may not inrude into the clearance areas
              authorized herein.

            <li>
              Bumper components not integral to the bodywork may be modified, substituted with a
              replica of alternate material, or removed provided all projecting hardware is also
              removed. Bumper bracket holes in the bodywork may be covered provided such
              covering serves no other purpose.  Bumper fascias integral with the bodywork may be
              modified or substituted with a replica of alternate material. Internal bumper
              components may be removed, replaced, or modified. Modified or replica bumpers/
              fascias must be of similar shape as standard components, completely cover the area
              of the OE bumper/fascia, and not confuse the identity of the vehicle.
            </li>
            <li>
              All interior trim, dash boards, gauges, floor covering, carpet, upholstery panels,
              and similar non-performance comfort or convenience items may be removed or replaced.
            </li>
            <li>
              The driver’s seat may be replaced with a seat of any origin. All passenger seats may
              be removed or replaced with seats of any origin. The driver’s seat must remain on
              the standard side of the car and may not cross the centerline of the car. The seat
              may be relocated fore/aft by up to 12.0” (30.5 cm) based on the centerline of the
              original front and rear mounting points. Rear bulkhead of the driver/passenger
              compartment may not be removed to relocate the seat and the driver’s seat may not
              extend rearward past the bulkhead.
            </li>
            <li>
              Doors may be lightened and may be replaced by ones of alternate materials. Doors
              may be pinned, but not bolted, to prevent their opening in case of an accident.
              Quick release fasteners (e.g., Dzus fasteners) are allowed. Standard door hinges and
              latch mechanisms may be removed, but the doors shall be capable of being opened or
              removed. Interior door panels may be removed or replaced and the door window slots
              may be covered. Alternate attachment devices may be added to hood and deck lid to
              supplement or replace the latches. Hood and deck lid hinges may be removed.

                  All windows may be replaced with polycarbonate material. The front windshield
                  shall have a minimum thickness of 1⁄8 inch (0.125”, 3.16 mm). Tinting of the
                  upper portion of the front windshield and the entire portion of all other
                  windows is allowed. All window replacements shall remain in the same position
                  in the frame or opening as the original glass it replaces; rubber molding is
                  optional.
                </li>
                <li>
                  All window channels and window winding mechanisms may be removed.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Closed cars: All side window glass may be removed. All rear hatchbacks and
                  deck lids shall be completely closed; poor alignment of bodywork or any other
                  means to prevent complete closure is not permitted.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Open cars: All windows and windshields (including windshield frames) may be
                  removed. The resulting window slots may be covered.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The installation of windshield safety clips, rear window safety straps, and
                  windshield safety straps is permitted.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              The contour of the fender may be altered (flared) for tire clearance provided the
              modifications do not confuse the identity of the car. Only standard production
              ventilation openings on the specific recognized model are permitted. Tires may
              extend beyond the bodywork. Fender wheel openings may be trimmed to provide tire
              clearance throughout the full range of suspension travel, but no more than is
              necessary for this purpose.
            </li>
            <li>
              Inner fender panels separating the wheel wells from the engine compartment may be
              altered, replaced, or removed. Rear inner fender panels may be altered, replaced, or
              removed provided there are panels providing total separation between
              driver/passenger compartment and wheels. A shock/strut tower integral to the inner
              fender panel is considered part of the inner fender panel and is included in this
              allowance.  This does not allow modification of frame/frame stubs beyond Section 17.2.C.
            </li>
            <li>
              Replacement, addition, or removal of accessories (gauges, switches, indicators,
              etc.), or other interior modifications for driver convenience, or to permit
              installation of required safety equipment, is authorized provided such
              modifications have no influence whatever on the mechanical performance of the car.
              Such modifications do not include the substitution or replacement of any bodywork
              or chassis component except those specifically authorized by these rules.
            </li>
            <li>
              The standard OE front spoiler or a non-standard front spoiler/splitter may be used.
              If a non-standard front spoiler/splitter is used it must comply with the following
              requirements: Shall be installed parallel to the ground (within ±3° fore and aft)
              and may extend a maximum of 6” (15.24 cm) forward of the frond bodywork/fascia as
              viewed from above. Splitters may not extend rearward past the centerline of the
              front wheels. No portion of the splitter may be wider than/extend beyond the
              widest part of the front bodywork/fascia from a vertical line drawn at the center of
              the front axles forward on the vehicle. The splitter and canards may have
              endplates. The endplates may connect the splitter and the canard. The splitter and
              canard endplate total surface area is limited to 100 sq. in. (645.2 cm2) for each
              side. Canards are allowed and may extend a maximum of 6” (15.24 cm) forward of front
              bodywork/fascia as viewed from above. No portion of the canard may extend past the
              widest part of the front bodywork/fascia as viewed from above. Canard area will be
              measured in the same manner as wings using Section 12.10. Canard area may not exceed
              1.2 sq. ft.  (1114.8 cm2). Openings are permitted for the purpose of ducting air to
              the brakes, radiator, and/ or oil cooler(s); equal openings may be placed in the
              standard lower front panel directly behind openings placed in the spoiler/splitter.
              The spoiler/splitter may not function as a wing. This allows a vertical
              airdam/spoiler above a horizontal splitter.
            </li>
            <li>
              A spoiler or wing may be added to the rear of the car provided it complies with
              either of the following:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  It is a production rear spoiler or wing which is standard or optional equipment
                  of a US model of the vehicle or an exact replica in an alternate material.
                </li>
                <li>
                  It is a non-production rear spoiler which is mounted to the rear portion of
                  the rear hatch, deck, or trunk lid. The spoiler may extend no more than 10.0”
                  (25.4 cm) from the original bodywork in any direction. Alternatively in a
                  hatchback, the spoiler may be mounted to the rear hatch lid at or near the top
                  of the hatch in such a configuration the spoiler may extend not more than 71⁄2
                  inches (7.50”, 19.1 cm) from the original bodywork in any direction. The spoiler
                  may be no wider that the bodywork. The use of endplates is prohibited. Spoiler
                  endplates are defined as any vertical (or semi-vertical) surfaces attached in
                  front of the spoiler which have the result of capturing and redistributing air
                  (downforce) along all or any portion of the spoiler.  The angle of attack is
                  free. The spoiler may not function as a wing.
                </li>
                <li>
                  For Classes XP, DP, EP and FP, wings may be added, removed, or modified. OE or
                  non-OE spoilers must be removed. Non-OE wings may only be attached to the
                  chassis or body behind the centerline of the rear axle. The total combined
                  surface area of all wings shall not exceed 8 sq. ft. (0.7432 m2) as calculated
                  per Section 12. The number of wing elements is limited to 2. Wings designed to
                  be adjustable while the car is in motion must be locked in a single position.
                  Spoilers under 17.2.P and rear wings are mutually exclusive such that a builder
                  may use one or the other, but not both. Wings, and any component thereof, may
                  not extend beyond the vehicle width as defined by the outermost portion of the
                  vehicle doors, less mirrors, door handles, rub strips, and trim. In addition, no
                  portion of the wing or its components may be more than 6” (15.24 cm) forward of
                  the rear axle, more than 0” (0.0 mm) beyond the rearmost portion of the
                  bodywork, or more than 6” (15.24 cm) above the roofline of the vehicle,
                  regardless of body style. Reinforcements to the wing mounting area may be used,
                  but may serve no other purpose. Wing endplate surface area is limited to 200 sq.
                  in. (1290.3 cm2) each and the number of endplates is limited to a maximum of 2.
                  For convertibles/roadsters with no roof and targas with no rear window, no
                  portion of the wing may be higher than 12” (30.48 cm) above the highest point of
                  the body that is behind the centerline of the rear axle. In the event that a
                  convertible/roadster with no roof or a targa-top with no rear window retains
                  the OE windshield frame with a windshield of any material that meets Section
                  17.2.K.1, the top of the windshield frame shall be considered the top of the
                  roofline and the car may use the wing mounting rules in Appendix A.1.c for a
                  closed car.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Vehicles equipped with an OE rear wing may add a rear spoiler only if the OE
                  wing and wing attachments are first removed.
                </li>

            <li>
              The fuel tank may be modified, replaced, or relocated. If the fuel tank is modified
              or replaced, the following restrictions apply:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The fuel tank/cell may be located within the same area as the OE tank.
                </li>
                <!-- TODO Clarify what this means -->
                <li>
                  If the fuel tank/cell does not fit within the same area as the OE tank, the
                  requirements of Section 3.3.3.B.27 must be met.
                </li>

              All mirrors and their associated mounting hardware may be removed or replaced.
            </li>
            <li>
              The hood, hatchback, deck lid, and fenders may be lightened or replaced by ones of
              alternate material provided the shape is similar to the original and does not
              confuse the identity of the vehicle. Factory bolt-on fenders may be replaced in
              their entirety. Cars with non-removable fenders may replace the front fender
              panels going forward from the foremost door opening and the rear fender panels going
              rearward from the rearmost door opening. Closed cars must not remove standard
              material above the horizontal line placed at the lowest point of the driver’s door
              window opening, with the exception that OE removable panels (e.g., T-tops, targa
              tops, sunroofs) may be removed or replaced with panels of alternate material
              provided that the dimensions of any replacement panel do not vary from those of the
              original by more than 1.0” (25.4 mm) in any direction. The approval of alternate
              body panels does not authorize the use of underbody or belly pans forward of the
              firewall or aft of the front edge of the rear wheel opening. Ground effect tunnels
              and/or attempts to gain ground effects are also not authorized.  Any such elements
              incorporated in the otherwise approved components must be removed or disabled.
              Front hoods and engine covers may be vented and/or louvered. The total area for all
              vents/louvers on a vehicle may not exceed 500 sq. in.  (3225.8 cm2), unless provided
              as standard equipment. The total area is measured as the total open area or the
              perimeter of the louvers when viewed from above.  The location, number, and shape of
              vents/louvers is unrestricted provided they are fully contained on allowed panels.
              For vehicles having original vents/louvers exceeding these dimensions, no further
              openings are permitted. Louver openings must face rearward and may stand no higher
              than 1.0” (25.4 mm) above the original surface. No additional scoops, cowls, bulges,
              or ducts are permitted unless specified in Appendix A.
            </li>
            <li>
              All headlights, front parking lights, and front signal lights may be removed.
              Headlight doors may be removed, replaced, or modified. Any remaining openings shall
              be covered with a wire mesh screen or panel of fiberglass, Plexiglas®, metal, or
              other nonflammable material. Ducts from headlights, headlight doors, front parking
              lights, and front signal lights may be used for ducting air to the engine, front
              brakes, and/or oil cooler(s). Any opening used for ducting may not be relocated.
              These ducts may pass through interior panels for this purpose. The cross section
              area of a single duct shall not exceed the cross sectional area of the original
              (single) headlight.
