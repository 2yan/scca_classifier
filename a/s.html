      <h3 class="sansserif">
        Any part of the exhaust system beyond (downstream from) the last catalytic converter,
        if so equipped, may be substituted or removed provided the system exits the car in the
        original location. Vehicles equipped with exhausts that exit in multiple locations may
        change to a single outlet in any of the original locations. Stainless steel heat
        exchangers are permitted only if the physical dimensions and configuration remain unchanged.
        Modifications of any type, including additions to or removal of, the catalytic converters,
        thermal reactors, or any other pollution control devices in the exhaust system are not
        allowed and the system must be operable. Replacement catalytic converters must be OE if
        the vehicle has not exceeded the warranty period as mandated by the EPA. Converters must
        be of the same type and size and used in the same location as the original equipment
        converter(s). This does not allow for a high performance unit. If the vehicle has exceeded
        the warranty period, replacement catalytic converters must be OE-type. Exhaust hangers
        which are bolted or welded on the car are considered part of the body and may not be
        changed or removed.
