# Contributing
First of all, thank you for your interest in this project! It is a large undertaking and I appreciate
all the help and feedback I can get.

## Styleguide
This project has an `.eslintrc.yml` file that defines the style standards for the project.
One item of note is dangling commas. We want dangling commas.This cleans up git diffs and makes
copy/pasting within the code much easier.
